## FAQ

### What is a ByeCorps ID?

A ByeCorps ID (BCID) is a seven digit alphanumeric (non-case sensitive) code used to identify a person. It is used to reduce the need of multiple accounts across ByeCorps services, as well as third-party services using OAuth (though a password alternative is recommended instead of BCID only)

Example of a BCID:

```txt
123 ABC4
```

## Connonical domain names

Only input your BCID on the following domain names ONLY on a HTTPS connection:

- https://id.byecorps.com

Any other domain name or an insecure connection might be a phishing attempt, so be careful. **NEVER** input your BCID password on any other domain.
